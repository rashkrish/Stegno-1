# Image Steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion

In this project, I focused on basic Image Steganography. This **LSB insertion** is a steganographic algorithm that finds the least significant bit in some bytes of the cover image file and swaps them with a sequence of bits present in the secret data or message.

Note: The code has one limitation that the code works for only those cover images having .png extension.
