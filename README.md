# Image Steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion

In this project, I had focused on basic Image Steganography. This LSB insertion is a steganographic algorithm that finds the least significant bit in some bytes of the cover image file and swaps them with a sequence of bits present in the secret data or message.
